Apple’s Business Goal
=====================

Our goal is to enhance our position as the innovator and premiere manufacturer of personal computers — the value leader, not the price leader. We intend to continue our strong sales growth worldwide. We will do this by concentrating on two key strengths:

**Human Engineering** — We build ‘friendly’ products whose simplicity and ease of use make them natural extensions of their owners. First and foremost, we build computers for *people*.

**Customer Service** — We’ve created a worldwide network of servicing retailers, distribution sites, and technical support centers unmatched in the industry. Our ability to provide products and support when and where our customers need them is critical to our success.


Apple’s Values
==============

Achieving our goal is important to us. But we’re equally concerned with the *way* we reach it. These are the values that govern our business conduct:

**Empathy for Customers / Users** — We offer superior products that fill real needs and provide lasting value. We deal fairly with competitors, and meet customers and vendors more than halfway. We are genuinely interested in solving customer problems, and will not compromise our ethics or integrity in the name of profit.

**Achievement / Aggressiveness** — We set aggressive goals, and drive ourselves hard to achieve them. We recognize that this is a unique time, when our products will change the way people work and live. It’s an adventure, and we’re on it together.

**Positive Social Contribution** — As a corporate citizen, we wish to be an economic, intellectual, and social asset in communities where we operate. But beyond that, we expect to make this world a better place to live. We build products that extend human capability, freeing people from drudgery and helping them achieve more than they could alone.

**Innovation / Vision** — We built our company on innovation, providing products that were new and needed. We accept the risks inherent in following our vision, and work to develop leadership products which command the profit margins we strive for.
