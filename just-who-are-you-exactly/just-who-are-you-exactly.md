Just who are you, exactly?
==========================

In my work as an educator and a business coach, one problem I frequently encounter are creatives who know what they do, but who also **don't know what they do**.

That's a little confusing, so I'll unpack it.

I've worked with countless creatives who can tell you: I'm a UX designer; or I'm a jeweller; or I'm an illustrator. But when I ask them to distill that down a little more and tell me what exactly they do (after all, 'illustrator' – to take just one of these creative pathways – is a very all-encompassing job title!).

Your story is critical:

> Your voice is what sets you apart: it’s the work that you do, it’s what you say, and it’s how you interact with others. Ask yourself: What do you have to say?

When I'm mentoring individuals, I help them to tease out their story using a series of tools as follows.

Anonymise this. At the moment it's for Naomi and I need to remove references to her. Perhaps talk about a 'brand strategist' I was working with and say I've anonymised it.

These were from last year when I was trying to work out what next for me. I’m heading away from web design towards strategy and running workshops for clients (mostly High-Level Strategy; UX /+ UI; Content Design, etc..). I’m also focusing on developing my profile as an educator, but like Seth Godin or David Hieatt, i.e. beyond the university.


## Notes + Tasks

### Task 1: Product DNA

I think you should start by undertaking a Product DNA exercise. Find three individuals (or companies) whose work you admire and respect and study them. What can you learn from them? Think about:

+ How they present themselves.
+ Their voice and tone.
+ How they articulate the services they’re offering.
+ How their websites are structured.
+ Etc.

For example, I learned from Mark Shayler that I needed a section of my new website – mrmurphy.com / dev.mrmurphy.com – that was focused on workshops. I put it second (after Strategy) because that is what I enjoy doing, so I may as well pitch it clearly.

I think for you, it should be individuals as that’s very much how I see your business moving forward. I see you as a high-level brand strategist working for world class clients and building a team – when needed – to help others establish a clearer brand story.

Look at other individuals who do this and see how they present themselves. Do they – like Paul Jarvis – use their own name, or do they have a ‘company name’? My gut reaction from our discussion is that you should use your own name. I also really like Atkinson White, because there’s a story there, but also because it’s the best of both worlds, it sounds like a company, but it also can be you solo.

This name only sounds like a solicitor if you brand it like a solicitor. Here’s my friend Andrew Fulton that I mentioned, who used the name Dawson Andrews.

That doesn’t look like a solicitors, it’s all about how you tell the story. 


### Task 2: Competitor Benchmarking and Analysis

With the above under your belt, undertake some competitor benchmarking and analysis. Rip apart others’ sites and look at the language they use (and also the visuals). That will help you shape your own site and help you tell the story. This is a little more detailed that the Product DNA, it’s more focused on the type of language others use.

Build a bank of words and phrases that you like so that you can start to build a brand dictionary. (On our next call, ask me about brand dictionaries, I have a slidedeck I can show you.)


### Task 3: Twitter Bio

The hardest part: Do the Twitter Bio exercise. This isn’t easy, but keep a history of your Bios as you write them. You’ll find this a useful exercise as it will force you to distill down to a short phrase. Like Cara’s: “…a silver landscape for the dining table.” That took months, so don’t expect magic right away. Stick at it.
