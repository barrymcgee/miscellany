Get Started With NFC
====================

*Estimated reading time: 5 minutes.*

**This content is a work-in-progress to include in my 2019-20 teaching at Belfast School of Art. I am new to Near Field Communication and I'm sharing what I've learned so far here. (I am by no means an expert.)**

The following is what I learned through the process of reading about and developing some projects for a Near Field Communication workshop. I'll be running this workshop for my [Interaction Design](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/courses/201920/interaction-design-15554) students this forthcoming academic year.

NFC Fundamentals
----------------

NFC (Near Field Communication) is **a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices** â€“ one of which is usually a portable device, for example, a smartphone â€“ **to establish communication by bringing them within ~four centimetres of each other**.

Unlike Bluetooth, **NFC doesnâ€™t require any form of device discovery or manual pairing to transfer data**, which opens it up to multiple potential uses. With Near Field Communication **a connection is automatically triggered when another NFC device is in range**. Once in range, the two devices instantly communicate and send prompts to the user.

**Youâ€™ve probably used Near Field Communication already, if youâ€™ve paid for something with a contactless reader,** if youâ€™re using Apple Pay or Samsung Pay or a contactless credit card.

NFC tags are relatively inexpensive on Amazon, just [Â£7.50 for 10](https://amzn.to/2YcqAId), or [Â£26.99 for 50](https://amzn.to/2M6YU58). You can also buy them in a [card size](https://amzn.to/2K12MSM) for creating card-based projects.

**54p per tag (for 50) is a low enough cost to buy some NFC tags to experiment with.** Once youâ€™ve decided how youâ€™re going to use them, you can buy them in bulk. **You can also buy them in bulk, pre-programmed.**



NFC Uses
--------

NFC tags contain **a small unpowered NFC chip**. Depending on how the tag is programmed, an NFC tag can: **change various settings, launch apps and perform certain actions,** just by holding your smartphone close to it.

The tag takes a small amount of power from the phone and sends the information that's stored on it to the phone.

There are a range of different types of data you can program into an NFC tag, for example:

+ A URL: This could be a URL to a web page, or a URL for an app on Appleâ€™s App Store or Googleâ€™s Play Store.

+ XXXX

+ YYYY 


Programming an NFC Tag
----------------------

**You can easily encode, erase, edit and lock an NFC tag in under a minute.** To do this, you just need to hover your phone over the tag and use an app to pass data to the tag.


### Apple

Unfortunately, Apple's iOS NFC SDK (Software Development Kit), Core NFC, [doesn't support writing NFC tags](https://help.gototags.com/article/writing-nfc-tags-ios/), only reading them. So, to program an NFC tag â€“ until Apple updates Core NFC, which it's working on for iOS 13 â€“ you'll need to use an Android device.

Apple has provided a useful overview of [Core NFC](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc), that's worth reading. They have also provided [sample code](https://docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/9db0175572/CreatingNFCTagsFromYourIPhone.zip) for a project (iOS 13, Beta) that allows you to [create NFC tags from your iPhone](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corenfc/creating_nfc_tags_from_your_iphone), saving data to tags and interacting with them using native tag protocols.

Unfortunately this is beta software, so â€“ unless youâ€™re running an iOS 13 Beta â€“ youâ€™ll need to wait for iOS 13â€™s stable release later in 2019. The good news is that native support is coming, albeit belatedly.

### Android

If youâ€™re running an Android device, you can get started right away.

Example Projects
----------------

### Rich Business Card

One of my summer projects â€“ preparing for my teaching in 2019-20 is the creation of a 'rich business card' that has data on it. It would be nice to have business cards that just said:

These cards would have an NFC tag on them that took you to my site, just by holding your phone near the card. Then I could give potential clients a business card that has all of my details programmed in.


### Educational Resource

Imagine being able to walk around an exhibition and be able toâ€¦ etc., etc..

In Closing
----------

NFC looks interesting and it's something we could explore in a short workshop for #ixdbelfast, perhaps in the â€˜Micro-Publicationsâ€™ workshop. I'm working on workshop resources â€“ this page is the start of this process â€“ so that we can explore this in the forthcoming academic year.
