Registering a Trademark
=======================

**This advice is for registering trademarks in the UK. I am not a lawyer, so you may wish to take legal advice.**

The following is what I learned through the process of registering a trademark for ‘Mr Murphy’ (my consultancy business that is focused on developing digital and printed learning materials).

—[Christopher Murphy][00]



Trademark Basics
----------------

The process to register a trademark takes about four months if no-one objects and a registered trademark lasts for 10 years.

**Registering a trademark in the UK only protects your brand in the UK. There are different processes for registering [EU and international trade marks][01].**

GOV.UK maintain a list of trademarks that you can search before you register your own trademark.

Trademarks are listed by classes. Each class contains a list of pre-approved terms that cover all of the goods or services included in that class.

+ Goods are listed in classes 1 to 34.
+ Services are listed in classes 35 to 45.

GOV.UK maintains a list of classes at [trade mark cross search list][02]. On this page you’ll gain an understanding of how different goods and services are classified. There is guidance provided on [this page][03].

For example, Trademark Class 41 is used if you are registering a trademark for **education, training, and sports and entertainment services**. This might include:

+ education services;
+ conducting educational workshops in the field of business; and
+ education services relating to design.

You can search for existing trademarks at GOV.UK’s [search for a trade mark][04] page. You can search for trade marks by:

+ trade mark number
+ owner
+ keyword, phrase or image

The first two are useful if you want to find out more about an existing trademark. The third is useful if you want to search for existing trademarks that use the same trademark as the one you are hoping to trademark.

Searching for a trademark [by word, phrase and / or image][05] allows you to refine your search by selecting class(es) and searching within specific date ranges.

The Intellectual Property Office (IPO) also has an online [Trade Marks Journal][06] with a link to the latest version. Here is the list from [19 July, 2019][07]. (The IPO website is a lot less user-friendly than the GOV.UK website.)

Because trademarks are listed in classes, you might find that someone is using the trademark you want to register – e.g. ‘Mr Murphy’ – but they’ve registered the trademark for a different class, perhaps Class 21 (cooking utensils), because they create bespoke kitchen knives.

As long as no one has registered your trademark in the class or classes you want, you should be able to trademark it.



Trademark Fees
--------------

As part of the trademark process, you can either:

1. pay up front; or
2. pay half by submitting a UK Right Start Trademark Application.

A ‘normal’ trademark application will cost £170 for one class. A Right Start trademark application will cost £200 for one class. The benefit of the Right Start application is that you get a report, letting you know if the trademark you want to register is available. If it’s not available, you don’t pay the balance (saving you money). If it is available you pay the balance.

It costs £50 for each additional class. So, for example, if I want to register ‘Mr Murphy’ in the following classes a Right Start application will cost £300:

+ Class 09: Downloadable educational course materials, etc..
+ Class 16: Educational books, etc..
+ Class 41: Education services, etc..

£200 for the Right Start application (which includes one class) and £100 for the two additional classes (£50 each).

There is [an overview of the fees][08] at the IPO website.



Register Your Trademark
-----------------------

If you’ve never registered a trademark before, read the [guide to new applications][09] before you start.

When you’re ready to register your trademark, GOV.UK has provided guidance on their [trade mark forms and fees][10] page. Once you’ve done your research, you can [apply to register a trade mark][11].

Do your research up-front. **You cannot change your trade mark once you’ve applied and the fees are non-refundable.**

When you’re ready, click on [apply now][12] (a large green button) and complete the various forms, of which there are a number.

Once you application is submitted (and paid for), you’ll receive an email from the Intellectual Property Office with a PDF copy of your trademark application. The IPO will normally process your response within 14 days.



A Note of Caution
-----------------

**Once again: This advice is for registering trademarks in the UK and I am not a lawyer, so you may wish to take legal advice.**
