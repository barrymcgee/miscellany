Scenarios
=========

*Estimated reading time: 1 minute.*

I developed the following scenarios for user research on a digital product design project. I’ve abstracted them – removing the project-specific details – so that they can be applied for other projects.

I’ve supplied a wide range of ages and contexts, specifically using:

1. a cross-section of different computing devices (high end desktops to low end mobile devices);
2. running a range of different operating systems (Windows to iOS 12).

Feel free to use them, or modify them, for your own work.


User Research Scenarios
-----------------------

+ A 17 year old is locked out of their account and is frustrated. She is using a high-end Dell Alienware Area-51 computer running Windows 10. (Electronic Arts)

+ A 54 year old man with low sight and visual impairments needs to find the warranty information for their headphones. He is using an iPad with a screen magnifier. (Bose)

+ A 30 year old mother is trying to find out how to turn on child-friendly restrictions for her children’s iPad. She is using an iPhone 7 and accessing the web with a poor internet connection. (Apple)

+ A 63 year old first-time user needs onboarding to tell him how to use the platform. He’s only experienced using Wordpress.

+ A 19 year old user has been asked to fix a critical mistake that has been discovered in a document. She’s under considerable pressure from senior management and it needs to be edited quickly.

+ A 36 year old experienced user is working from home on a remote working trial. They are using a slow, enterprise computer with an old browser.

+ A 24 year old user, who has just joined the business has been asked to create a series of support documents. She’s on a laptop with broken trackpad and has to use keyboard navigation.
